# Lime curd

## Intro

Easy lime curd that can be used in cakes/pies. I used this for a swiss roll.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup sugar (more or less depending on how you like it)
* 3/4 cup lime juice
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 tbs lime zest
* 2 eggs, beaten (yay! No need to separate yolks!)
* Optional: grated ginger to taste, substitute lime with lemon

## What you need

* double boiler - I put a glass pyrex container on top of a steamer rack in a pot (I can just cover and store after!)
* Whisk 
* An immersion blender (optional)
* Glass jar for storing

## How to do it

Place sugar, lime juice and zest into the double boiler. 

Stir over medium heat - or leave it until butter melts (I left it while I was dealing with beating the eggs).

Mix 2 tablespoons of hot lime mixture into beaten eggs and stir - the idea is to get it to a good temperature where it does not just curdle when added to the lime mixture in the double boiler.

Slowly whisk the egg mixture into the lime mixture.

Optional: Use immersion blender to blend mixture - I find this to be nice to get rid of any potential eggy chunks that were not beaten properly.

Cook over double boiler, stirring occasionally until it thickens and holds up when dripped into mixture - does not just blends back into the mixture, 20 to 25 minutes.

Cool and store in glass jar. Refrigerate.
